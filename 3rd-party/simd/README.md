# Maths Town SIMD Library

A small header-only SIMD library made for use with Maths Town projects.  I've made it public in case it useful to anyone. (Permissive MIT license)

## Overview.
This library abstracts SIMD types into more useful types.  It has two goals.
- Allow generic code to be written that is optimised for different SIMD CPUs. 
- Allow generic code to run at different precision levels (same code for f32 or f64).  This is common need for my fractal code.

c++20 is required.

This repository is being prepared as a standalone open source library that can be used via git subtree.

### CPU Levels.
The code targets 4 different CPU levels:
 - Fallback - A fallback for non x86_64, such as wasm.
 - x86_64 level 1 (SSE2 +) - Covers practically all x86_64 CPUs.  128 bit insructions.
 - x86_64 level 3 (AVX2 +) - CPUs that fully implement 256bit instructions.
 - x86_64 level 4 (AVX-512 +) - CPUs that fully implement 512bit instructions.

 - Extra instructions (such as SSE4.1, AVX) are used if detected at compile time.

Generally, CPUs are restricted to the lower support level if they only have partial implmentation of an instruction size.  For example, there are some older CPUs that support AVX but not AVX2, these will need to use 128bit instrucitons.

For Windows, the best option is one build per x86-64 level.  Dispatch at download or install time. It is also possible to dispatch to different dynamic library files (.dll) at runtime.  Functions for runtime detection are included.

For Linux, compile from source.

Runtime dispatch is supported on MSVC only, but is much slower than compile time dispatch (using 512bit instructions when the compiler is not optimising 512 bit registers is sub-optimal).

### Generic Functions
You can write generic code for any floating point type (f32 or f64) like so:
```
template <SimdFloat S>
void my_function(S x, Sy); 
```
SimdFloat is a concept that will accept any of the floating point types above, or any user type that implements the concept.

## Compilers Specific Notes
Transcendental math operations fully implemented on MSVC by using the SVML library.  However other compilers use a simple fallback mechanism where lanes are unpacked and the std library is used.  I will try to implement these operations one day.

### Microsoft C++ Compiler
  Transcendental math operations such as `sin()`, `cos()`, `tan()`, `log()`, and `exp()` use the SVML library so are fully simd.

### Clang
  SVML is not available.  Transcendental math operations such as `sin()`, `cos()`, `tan()`, `log()`, and `exp()` use my code, which are currently just slow fallbacks. 

### GCC
  SVML is not available.  Transcendental math operations such as `sin()`, `cos()`, `tan()`, `log()`, and `exp()` use my code, which are currently just slow fallbacks. 

  GCC disables intrinsics if they are not supported, so types that are not supported will not be exposed when compiling with GCC.


## Testing Suite
If you wish to run tests, these are currently setup to run under PowerShell for Windows.  There are tests for 3 windows compilers: MSVC, gcc and clang (as clang-cl).

Windows (PowerShell), from the repository root (default generator/compiler on your machine):

```powershell
cmake -S tests -B build
cmake --build build --config Release
```

Run the executable from the location your generator uses:

```powershell
# Visual Studio generators
.\build\Release\simd_test.exe

# Single-config generators such as Ninja or MinGW Makefiles
.\build\simd_test.exe
```

### Test Microsoft C++ Compiler

Windows (PowerShell), explicitly with MSVC (`cl`):

```powershell
cmake -S tests -B build\msvc -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64
cmake --build build\msvc --config Release
.\build\msvc\Release\simd_test.exe
```

This path is configured as a runtime-dispatch build. The binary is compiled with `/arch:AVX2`, and the test harness uses runtime CPU detection to decide whether the `Simd128`, `Simd256`, and `Simd512` suites should execute.

### Test Clang (clang-cl) C++ Compiler

Windows (PowerShell), explicitly with Clang (`clang-cl`):

```powershell
cmake -S tests -B build\clang -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 -T ClangCL
cmake --build build\clang --config Release
.\build\clang\Release\simd_test.exe
```

This path is compile-time gated. Only the SIMD widths enabled by the compiler flags/macros for that build are expected to execute.

### Test GCC C++ Compiler 
GCC really does not like to see intrinsics from higher levels in the code, even if they are unreachable. There is a separate compilation mode to test each level of support, to make sure I don't rely on runtime checks for this in GCC.  (Whereas other compilers we just check at runtime)

Windows (PowerShell), GCC level 1 mode (128 bit types, `SSE2` minimum):

```powershell
cmake -S tests -B build\gcc-sse2 -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++ -DSIMD_TEST_MODE=SSE2
cmake --build build\gcc-sse2
.\build\gcc-sse2\simd_test.exe
```

Windows (PowerShell), GCC level 3 mode (256 bit types, `AVX2` minimum):

```powershell
cmake -S tests -B build\gcc-avx2 -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++ -DSIMD_TEST_MODE=AVX2
cmake --build build\gcc-avx2
.\build\gcc-avx2\simd_test.exe
```

Windows (PowerShell), GCC level 4 mode (512 bit types, `AVX-512f and AVX-512dq` minimum):

```powershell
cmake -S tests -B build\gcc-avx512 -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++ -DSIMD_TEST_MODE=AVX512
cmake --build build\gcc-avx512
.\build\gcc-avx512\simd_test.exe
```

The `gcc-avx512` executable is a true AVX-512 target. It must be run on a machine that supports the AVX-512 feature set compiled into that binary.

### Test Emscripten / WebAssembly

The browser build writes the generated site bundle into `build/public_html`. The Emscripten compile and link steps both use `-msimd128`, so the Wasm SIMD128 `Simd128*` tests run when the browser supports Wasm SIMD.

```powershell
emcmake cmake -S tests -B build\emscripten -G Ninja
cmake --build build\emscripten
```

Run 
```
python -m http.server 8081 --directory build/public_html  
```
to start a small testing server on port 8081
